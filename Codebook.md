 These functions together allow the user to cache matrix inverses and retrieve them in order to simplify computations. The function makeCacheMatrix creates a list of functions, which we can think of as a special kind of "matrix."  It allows the user to set matrix values, to get the value of the created matrix, to set the value of its inverse, and get the value of its inverse.   

### How to run ###

Source cachematrix.R into your R console.  Feed it invertible matrices. Thatâ€™s it.
